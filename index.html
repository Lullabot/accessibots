          <p>We are the Accessibots, an accessibility working group at Lullabot with a passion for making the web usable for everyone.  Accessibility tends to be an afterthought for most of us.  We make excuses like "it will add too much cost to the project," or "I can't make Drupal do that," or it may be that we simply don't know we're doing it.  That's where we come in.</p>
