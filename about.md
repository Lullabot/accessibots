title: Who We Are

We are the Accessibots, an accessibility working group at Lullabot with a passion for making the web usable for everyone.

Accessibility tends to be an afterthought for most of us. We make excuses like "it will add too much cost to the project," or "I can't make Drupal do that," or it may be that we simply don't know we're doing it. That's where we come in. The Accessibots began as a small yammer chat between a few Lullabots. That started to garner some real interest in learning more and sharing tools, so we thought, why not do a small presentation for the other team members. Well, we were so excited that we couldn't think of just two or three things to present about, so we decided to turn it into a full presentation.

Now, I'm sure we've all been told about accessibility and we know we should do it, but being lectured is not a great way to learn. Naturally, we had to take things one step further so we started a website where we could share our presentations, notes, resources tools and have live demonstrations so you can see (or hear) how developing for accessibility actually works.

In the future, we'll be adding lots of great demos and resources, so stay tuned!

If there is something in particular you'd like us to present on or to post, shoot us a tweet! We'd love to hear from you!
