Our session wasn't accepted for DrupalCon Los Angeles, but that's not going to stop us!  We have a BoF setup for Tuesday morning at 10:45am in room 503, the MediaCurrent room.  Stop on by with your questions, tips or just overall curiosity.  We'd love to meet you!

We do have a limited supply of the original LillyBot stickers, so if you make the pledge to build your site accessibly, you just might earn your badge.
